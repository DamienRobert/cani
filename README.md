# Cani

![cani cli](/assets/cani.png)

Cani is a small command-line wrapper around the data of [caniuse](https://caniuse.com).
It uses [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) to display results.
This wrapper aims to be easy to use out of the box. To achieve this it ships with completions
for `bash`, `fish`, and `zsh`. [Caniuse data (1.7MB)](https://github.com/Fyrd/caniuse/blob/master/data.json) is fetched and updated automatically
on a regular interval together with completions.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cani'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cani

## Configuration

After installation, running the command (`cani`) for the first time will create some files and directories:

- `~/.config/cani/config.yml` - default configuration
- `~/.config/cani/caniuse.json` - caniuse api data
- `~/.config/cani/completions/_cani.bash` - bash completion
- `~/.config/cani/completions/_cani.zsh` - zsh completion
- `~/.config/fish/completions/cani.fish` - fish completions

Some existing files will also be modified:

- `~/.bashrc` - A source line to bash completions will be added, or updated if it exists
- `~/.zshrc` - A source line to zsh completions will be added, or updated if it exists

After running the command for the first time, please restart your shell or `source` your `~/.*rc` file to load completions.
There are some commented settings that can be adjusted in the `~/.config/cani/config.yml` file.

## Usage

Running `cani` without arguments yields the help description.
Cani supports the following actions:

- [`use`](#use) - show browser support for all features
- [`show BROWSER VERSION`](#show) - show feature support based on selected browser / version
- [`help`](#help) - show help
- [`version`](#version) - print the version number
- [`update`](#update) - force update data and completions
- [`install_completions`](#install_completions) - install shell completions
- [`purge`](#purge) - purge files and directories created by `cani`

### use

```sh
cani use
```

Show a list of features with fzf. Features are shown with their current W3C status, percentage of support, title and
each individual browser's support on a single row.

### show

```sh
cani show
```

Show a list of browsers. Selecting a browser will take you to the versions for that browser.
Selecting a version shows the final window with feature support for that specific browser version.
Navigating to the previous window is possible by pressing <kbd>escape</kbd>, this will move you up one level.
When <kbd>escape</kbd> is pressed at the browser selection menu, the command will exit.

This command can also be invoked directly with a browser and version:

```sh
# show all versions of chrome
cani show chr

# show all supported features in chrome 70
cani show chr 70
```

### help

```sh
cani help
```

Displays short help for the `cani` command

### version

```sh
cani version
```

Displays the current version e.g: `0.1.0`

### update

```sh
cani update
```

Force update dataset and completions.

### install_completions

```sh
cani install_completions
```

Completions are supported for `zsh`, `bash` and `fish` shells (currently).
They are automatically installed upon first invocation of the `cani` command.
This command is only a fallback in case there were any issues with permissions etc..

### purge

```sh
cani purge
```

Purges all files created by this command, removing every trace except the executable itself.
It will also remove source lines added that pointed to the completions in `~/.zshrc` and `~/.bashrc`.
After running a `purge`, all that remains is running `gem uninstall cani` to completely purge it.

## Pipe output

Last but not least, all `cani` commands can be piped. This will skip running `fzf` and print uncolored output.

**use**
```sh
cani use | cat | head -3
